# RFC-XXXX: [Title]

- **Status**: Draft | Under Review | Accepted | Rejected | Implemented
- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Authors**: @username
- **Tracking Issue**: #NNN (if applicable)

## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

Focus on explaining the motivation clearly without diving into implementation details.

## Guide-level Explanation

Explain the proposal as if teaching it to another developer. Introduce new concepts, explain by example, and describe the impact on users.

This section should help readers understand:
- What new capabilities this enables
- How existing workflows change (if at all)
- Concrete examples of usage

## Reference-level Explanation

Technical details of the design. This section should cover:

- API changes (new methods, parameters, types)
- Data format changes
- Interaction with existing components
- Edge cases and error handling

Keep code examples minimal and focused. Pseudocode is acceptable.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Consider:
- Implementation cost
- Integration complexity
- Maintenance burden
- Breaking changes (if any)

## Design Decisions

Document key design decisions using the format:

### D1: [Decision title]

**Decision**: What was decided.

**Rationale**: Why this choice was made.

**Alternatives considered**: What other options were evaluated and why they were rejected.

---

Repeat for each significant design decision (D2, D3, etc.)

## Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this design the best among alternatives?
- What other designs were considered and why were they rejected?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design are still TBD?
- What related issues are out of scope for this RFC?
- What questions need to be resolved during implementation?

## Future Possibilities

How might this proposal be extended in the future? What adjacent features might build on this?

This section is a place to dump ideas that are related but out of scope for the current RFC.
