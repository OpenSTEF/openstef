This page contains guides and links to resources that show how OpenSTEF can be used.

Pipelines - high level functionality
------------------------------------
Pipelines (see :ref:`concepts <concepts>` for definition) offer an easy way to use OpenSTEF for training models, generating forecasts, and evaluation of forecasting performance.

The following pipelines are available:

- :mod:`openstef.pipeline.train_model`
- :mod:`openstef.pipeline.create_forecast`
- :mod:`openstef.pipeline.optimize_hyperparameters`
- :mod:`openstef.pipeline.create_component_forecast`
- :mod:`openstef.pipeline.create_basecase_forecast`
- :mod:`openstef.pipeline.train_create_forecast_backtest`

The easiest way to get started and get familiar with pipelines is to have a look at
`this GitHub repository that contains an assortment of examples Jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/OpenSTEF/openstef-offline-example>`_, including example data.
Each of these example notebooks can be ran locally without any setup required, apart from the `installation of the OpenSTEF package <https://pypi.org/project/openstef/>`_.

- Usage of the train model pipeline is demonstrated in
  `this example Jupyter Notebook <https://github.com/OpenSTEF/openstef-offline-example/blob/master/examples/01.%20Train%20a%20model%20using%20high-level%20pipelines.ipynb>`_.
- Usage of the create forecast pipeline is demonstrated in
  `this example Jupyter Notebook <https://github.com/OpenSTEF/openstef-offline-example/blob/master/examples/04.%20Test_on_difficult_cases.ipynb>`_.
- Usage of the train model and forecast backtest pipeline is demonstrated in multiple notebooks, for instance
  `this example Jupyter Notebook <https://github.com/OpenSTEF/openstef-offline-example/blob/master/examples/02.%20Evaluate%20performance%20using%20Backtest%20Pipeline.ipynb>`_.

The notebooks mentioned above are aimed towards a backtesting setting.
More in depth information on how to use and implement the pipelines in an operational setting, including code examples, is provided on the following page:

Forecasting application - full implementation
---------------------------------------------

For those who wish to set up a fully functioning forecasting application that is ready to be used in an operational setting, a
`GitHub repository with a reference implementation <https://github.com/OpenSTEF/openstef-reference>`_  is available.
The example implementation includes databases, a user interface, and example data.
More information on what the architecture of such an application could look like can be found :ref:`here <application-architecture>`.

Example Jupyter notebooks
