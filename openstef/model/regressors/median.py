class MedianRegressor(OpenstfRegressor, RegressorMixin):
    """
    Median regressor implementing the OpenSTEF regressor API.
    Note that this is a autoregressive model, meaning that it uses the previous
    predictions to predict the next value.

    This regressor is good for predicting two types of signals:
    - Signals with very slow dynamics compared to the sampling rate, possibly
      with a lot of noise.
    - Signals that switch between two or more states, which random in nature or
    depend on unknown features, but tend to be stable in each state. An example of
    this may be waste heat delivered from an industrial process. Using a median
    over the last few timesteps adds some hysterisis to avoid triggering on noise.

    Tips for using this regressor:
    - Set the lags to be evenly spaced and at a frequency mathching the
      frequency of the input data. For example, if the input data is at 15
      minute intervals, set the lags to be at 15 minute intervals as well.
    - Use a small training dataset, since there are no actual parameters to train.
    - Set the frequency of the input data index to avoid inferring it. Inference might be
    a problem if we get very small chunks of data in training or validation sets.
    - Use only one training horizon, since the regressor will use the same lags for all
      training horizons.
    - Allow for missing data by setting completeness_threshold to 0. If the prediction horizon
      is larger than the context window there will be a lot of nans in the input data, but
      the autoregression solves that.
