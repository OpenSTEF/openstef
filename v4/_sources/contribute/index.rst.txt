GitHub issue tracker
====================

The `issue tracker <https://github.com/OpenSTEF/openstef/issues>`_ serves as the
centralized location for making feature requests, reporting bugs, identifying major
projects to work on, and discussing priorities.

We have preloaded the issue creation page with markdown forms requesting the information
we need to triage issues and we welcome you to add any additional information or
context that may be necessary for resolving the issue:
